Workflows are identified by their name (it is unique).
The class (and procedure inside that) that check workflow and create new processes is a synchronized class, so only one thread at time can create a process.
If a thread are creating a new workflow, the other are blocked. When the first thread have finished to create the new workflow and the new process, other thread enter
in the "createProcessInWorkflow" procedure and seen that the workflow they are search is present yet.
